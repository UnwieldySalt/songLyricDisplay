            Over me and over you<br>
            I came by to say I'm confused about last week when you said<br>
            "Hello, we should go to Tokyo"<br>
            I think about you quite a lot<br>
            At least enough to question what is causing me<br>
            To think so much about someone it keeps me up and
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If you rip open my heart you'd see<br>
            A whole lotta' blood and arteries<br>
            But if I'm talking romantically<br>
            You'd see space for you

        <p>
            I remember at the pub<br>
            The tea towel hanging at your butt<br>

            And so I came that very night<br>
            I read a book I didn't like<br>
            I was approached by some old guy he<br>
            Bought me a glass of cheap wine<br>
            He had a piano on his tie and

            If you rip open my heart you'd see<br>
            A whole lotta' blood and arteries<br>
            But if I'm talking romantically<br>
            You'd see space for you

        <p>
            If you rip open my heart you'd see<br>
            A whole lotta' blood and conquered arteries<br>
            But if I'm talking romantically<br>
            You'd see space for you
        </p>

            You'd see space for you
